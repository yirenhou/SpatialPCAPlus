Description: This package provides the Nearest Neighborhood Gaussian Process function (NNGP_InverseKernel.R) to approximate inverse of kernel matrix K defined from the underlying latent factor model in Spatial PCA. It also provides functions to estimate loading matrix W and latent factor matrix Z by integrating output (K inverse, determinant of K) approximated by Nearest Neighborhood Gaussian Process. Additional test cases looking at computational time are performed in NewTestingCodes folder.
