# SpatialPCAPlus
This contains all the codes for BIOSTAT 615 Project SpatialPCAPlus. Below describes each folder and code for easier navigation.

Data folder - contains cortex data from DLPFC (LIBD), Mouse cerebellum data by Slide-seq, HER2 tumpor data used for real data analysis.
NewTestingCodes - responsible for test cases comparing computational time between NNGP approximation of inverse matrix K and eigen-decomposition for inverse
                  matrix

BuildTestingKernels function, nngp_approx function, nngpMethodEquations_InverseKernel function, SpatialPCAEquations
